        <h3 id="headline">A view into these cats' lives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>March 5th, 2021</strong> - Yuki was born in the comfort of his foster home with Our Farm Santuary. He has two brothers and one sister that have been adopted. </li>
          <li><strong>July 11th, 2021</strong> - I adopted Yuki from Our Farm Sanctuary and took him home.</li>
          <li><strong>November 12, 2021</strong> - Yami showed up on our doorstep. She was small and sickly, so we took her in and started caring for her. </li>
          <li><strong>December 4th, 2021</strong> - Yang appeared outside our door begging for food. We said hello, fed him, and made plans to TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release) him.</li>
          <li><strong>December 28th, 2021</strong> - Yang showed up limping and with a cut on his back right leg. We took him inside and scheduled a vet appointment. Little did we realize, he would be a permanent family member.</li>
          <li><strong>January 28th, 2022</strong> - Both Yami and Yang got their spay/neuter surgeries. After healing, they can finally interact and play with each other!</li>
          <li><strong>September 1st, 2023</strong> - Official move in day to a bigger house, with stairs! The cats explore and settle in. They love chasing each other up and down the stairs. Yami is a bit more nervous about the move than the boys.</li>
        </ul>
